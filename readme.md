## How to Run

Open up a terminal or command line and `cd` into the root directory. Then run either `npm run start-mac` or `npm run start-windows` depending on your OS.

If you have a different OS but have node installed, run `node index.js` from the root directory and then open a browser to `http://localhost:3000`
